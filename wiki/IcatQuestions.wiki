    * Why Partition only on datafile_parameter table? What are the drawback to use partition on all XXX_parameter table?
    * (SYC) Investigator table has no check constraint for the Investigator.Role attribute. An insert into this table will fire the trg_investigator trigger which adds a ICAT_AUTHORISATION record for the investigation. The trigger currently only checks for Investigor.Role = 'principal_experimenter' or 'experimenter'. If you enter any other value, the trigger will fail.
    * (SYC) The trg_investigator trigger does not check if the investigator.id is a valid fedid or not. There should be a linkup with either People or Active Directory here. 

=== General ===

    * (SYC) There is no operation manual for support purposes. For instance, Are there control vocabularies for the common audit attributes. I've seen different values being put into mod_id and creator_id (eg. 'FIRST_PROPAGATION','FROM_SPREADSHEET','ICATISIS_DEV_NEW'....)
